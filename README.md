Demos for custom HTML elements, Shadow DOM and Polymer.

This project was started by Herbert Braun and featured in c't Magazin 24/2013. More information about the project: www.woerter.de/textverzeichnis/#filter/id=165 (in German). At the time of writing, Custom HTML with Shadow DOM is highly experimental and works only in Chrome; the Polymer demo runs in all major browsers.

Comments and variable names are in German. I'll gladly translate them if there is demand.
